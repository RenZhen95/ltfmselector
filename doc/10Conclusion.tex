In conclusion, the gait assessments in terms of the SMS, prescribed by an interdisciplinary medical board was well reproduced from gait data by training an agent that can dynamically select salient features, and a corresponding PM. More importantly, the agent was able to select a subset of features specific to a patient. These patient-specific features could potentially aid clinicians in better designing personalized therapy, especially with earlier research \cite{lee2020,pistacchi2017,huang2016,biase2020} indicating the importance of accounting for inter-patient variability, and the relevant biomarkers evolving as a function of disease progression. These synergistic interactions between system, and experts may improve the quality in diagnosis and help objectify therapeutic targets.
