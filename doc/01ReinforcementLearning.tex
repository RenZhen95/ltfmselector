RL is a branch of machine learning that deals with learning control laws and policies to interact with an environment, via trial-and-error to achieve a long-term objective \cite{mnih2015,sutton2018,brunton2022}. The learning is guided via feedback, or \emph{reinforcement}, a concept biologically inspired from animal psychology. Animals have been observed to be ``hardwired'' to recognize pain and hunger as negative rewards, and food intake as positive rewards, and thus, mold their behavior accordingly to best maximize (positive) rewards \cite{pavlov2010,brunton2022}. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:RLSchematic}, an \emph{agent} senses the \emph{state} of its \emph{environment}, and learns to take \emph{actions} that maximizes \emph{cumulative future rewards}.

  \caption{Schematic of RL, where an agent senses its environmental state $\nvec{s}$ and performs an action $a$, according to a policy $\policy$ that is optimized through learning to maximize cumulative future rewards $R$. In recent works, a typical approach to represent the policy $\policy$ is to use a deep neural network. Such a policy is known as a \emph{deep policy network}. Figure adapted from \cite{brunton2022}.}
