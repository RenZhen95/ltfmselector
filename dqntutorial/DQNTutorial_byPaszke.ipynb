    "an action, the environment *transitions* to a new state, and also\n",
    "returns a reward that indicates the consequences of the action. In this\n",
    "task, rewards are +1 for every incremental timestep and the environment\n",
    "terminates if the pole falls over too far or the cart moves more than\n",
    "2.4 units away from center. This means better performing scenarios will\n",
    "run for longer duration, accumulating larger return.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CartPole task is designed so that the inputs to the agent are 4 real\n",
    "values representing the environment state (position, velocity, etc.). We\n",
    "take these 4 inputs without any scaling and pass them through a small\n",
    "fully-connected network with 2 outputs, one for each action. The network\n",
